# googlesheetsworldcatThis report processes a list of OCLC numbers representing newly-acquired titles held by the Amon Carter Museum of American Art Research Library and retrieves bibliographic and holdings information for each title using the WorldCat Search API v.2.

The report shows which titles are are uniquely held by the library, and if there are multiple holdings, the report lists the next nearest library with the title. Each title includes a link to the CDLC catalog, which provides more information.
